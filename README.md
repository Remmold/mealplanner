# 🥗 MealPlanner

> ⚠️ This project is **under active development** and currently in an early stage.  
> The goal of MealPlanner is to provide a smart meal planning and nutrition tool that supports families and individuals with different dietary needs, allergies, and preferences.  

MealPlanner will combine **recipe management, nutritional overview, shopping list generation**, and **LLM-powered recipe modification** into one app.  
The long-term vision is to make it easy for households to plan meals together, manage grocery shopping, and adapt recipes to everyone’s needs.

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (prototype), future React/Lovable app
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic
- **Database**: DuckDB (local dev, cloud later)
- **Data Pipeline**: dlt (ingestion) + dbt (transformations)
- **ETL Flow**: Structured into `raw → staging → dim → fct`
